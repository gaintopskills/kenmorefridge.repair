        <br>
        <p> Here are common problems to be aware of:</p>
    
        <h2>1. Temperature Fluctuations:</h2>
        <p>If your Kenmore fridge is experiencing inconsistent cooling in the refrigerator or freezer compartments, it may indicate problems with the thermostat, sensors, or compressor. Call a technician if temperature issues persist.</p>
    
        <h2>2. Ice Maker Malfunctions:</h2>
        <p>Issues with the ice maker, such as irregular ice production, overproduction, or problems with the ice dispenser, may require professional attention. A technician can diagnose and repair the ice maker components effectively.</p>
    
        <h2>3. Water Leakage:</h2>
        <p>Water pooling inside or around the refrigerator may signal issues with the defrost system, water inlet valve, or a clogged drain. Contact a technician to identify and fix the root cause of the leakage.</p>
    
        <h2>4. Unusual Noises:</h2>
        <p>Strange sounds like buzzing, clicking, or rattling may indicate issues with the compressor, fan motors, or other internal components. Professional diagnosis is recommended to address unusual noises effectively.</p>
    
        <h2>5. Faulty Compressor:</h2>
        <p>A malfunctioning compressor can lead to temperature control problems and inadequate cooling. If you notice your fridge not maintaining the desired temperature, it's time to call a technician.</p>
    
        <h2>6. Door Seal Damage:</h2>
        <p>A compromised door gasket can affect the efficiency of your Kenmore refrigerator. If you observe visible damage or feel cool air escaping, a technician can replace the door seal promptly.</p>
    
        <h2>7. Refrigerator Not Running:</h2>
        <p>If your Kenmore fridge fails to turn on or experiences frequent power interruptions, it requires immediate attention. A technician can diagnose and address electrical issues affecting the appliance's operation.</p>
    
        <h2>When to Call a Technician:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>**Persistent Issues:** If problems persist despite basic troubleshooting, it's time to seek professional help.</li>
            <li>**Electrical or Component Failure:** For issues related to electrical components or critical parts like the compressor, a technician's expertise is essential.</li>
            <li>**Warranty Concerns:** If your refrigerator is still under warranty, calling a certified technician ensures that repairs are covered and performed according to manufacturer standards.</li>
            <li>**Safety Concerns:** If you notice any issues that may pose safety risks, such as strange odors or smoke, contact a technician immediately.</li>

        <p> Regardless of the type of unit you will select, it's crucial to recognize that many issues with your unit
            stem from inadequate and untimely maintenance. Dust accumulation within the dryer is a common concern, and
            should be cleaned out at least once a year. If you have pets, particularly multiple ones, professional
            cleaning twice a year is recommended.</p>
        <p>The presence of dust inside the unit can lead to wear and tear of moving components, while also causing the
            unit to overheat and compromise electrical parts. Following every LG dryer repair, our technicians use
            specialized tools to professionally clean the unit's interior.</p>
        <p>If you observe signs of malfunction, such as unusual noise or vibration, don't hesitate to contact us.
            Addressing these issues promptly can prevent further damage to your dryer, ultimately saving you from more
            costly repairs over time.</p>
        <p>A dryer full of dust poses risks not only to the appliance but also to your health. The lint accumulated
            within the dryer has the potential to escape and disperse into the air, contaminating your indoor
            environment.</p>

        <p> In instances where a unit undergoes inadequate maintenance, combustible lint and dust have a tendency to
            accumulate, forming a blanket across all components. As the unit operates, the risk of an open fire
            occurrence significantly increases. The potential ignition of this "dust blanket" is not always apparent to
            the owners and can sporadically happen.</p>
        <p> The only factor preventing a potential house fire is the limited time the wires inside the unit have to
            catch fire. To mitigate this risk, it is strongly advised to clean your unit annually, and if you have pets,
            a biannual cleaning is highly recommended.</p>
